// There a few differences between a basic practice code and a production code.
// - The main difference is that a production code is more secure and optimised.
// - It is also more scalable and maintainable.
// - It is also more robust and reliable.

// - It is used to store sensitive information like API keys, database credentials etc.
// - It is also used to store environment variables.
// - It is also used to store configuration variables.

// - Just go to any deployment service provider.
// - Give them the url of your app either through gitHub, gitLab, dockerHub etc.
// - setup the environment variables.
// - Choose the plan that you want.
